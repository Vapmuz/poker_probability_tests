# poker_probability_tests
What's in the project:
    a class to handle the card
    a class to handle the deck

The project:

     I must make the hands: a class that takes an object and adds it to a list in itself:
        Hand():
            Hand.add_card(card) = adds the card
            Hand.cards = [list of the cards]  

    
    I must make the asssembler class. It does the job of instantiating the hands and the pools. The hands must be represented using a list to take them all together.
The class takes a list (the deck or decks) and uses it to 

        assembler(list)


TODO:
    I have found a lot of problems in the rapresentation of the card when trying to represent the  cards after teh assembler process. 
    add new tests [ ]
    display the cards in a clean way [ ] 
    make the classes have a good inheritance [ ]
