# poker_probability_tests
What's in the project:
    a class to handle the card
    a class to handle the deck

What I'm going to do:
    a class to handle the hand
    a class to handle the win condition
    a class to handle the game logic



TO DO:
     I must make the hands: a class that contains a list that takes a card in an exact position (if I call hand(1, pool) then the hand must contain the first card draw in the pool, hand(2, pool) then the second)
     this helps dividing the hands when I will do the game

     then I must do the calculate points class, a class that given two lists (the hand and the pool) give a rank based on the Hands of poker (couple, double couple...)

     then I will have the hand assembler, a function that makes the game start (a cicle that gives the cards, and the hands when drawn)

     then I will have to do the game, using the assembler a interactive function that makes the game possible






TODO:
    I have found a lot of problems in the rapresentation of the card when trying to represent the  cards after teh assembler process. 
    add new tests [ ]
    display the cards in a clean way [ ]
